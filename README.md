## Behind the scenes

[`@pika/snowpack`](https://github.com/pikapkg/snowpack) (_previously named `@pika/dev`_) to convert every compilation dependencies
(located in `package.json`'s `dependencies` section) to web bundles copied once for all (at `npm install` time) in `web_components/` folder)

SASS compilation is splitted in 2 :
- Applicative SASS compilation
- Vendors SASS compilation (example illustrated with the `foundation` CSS lib, but you can use whatever lib you want here).   
  _Because we don't want to spend all our CPU time for third party vendors SASS dependencies that never change over time._
